Snake Game
This is a simple Snake game developed using Python's turtle graphics module. The game was created during my first year of studies as a project to learn about the turtle library, while also having fun with game development, which I am passionate about.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's movement:
Up Arrow – Move Up
Down Arrow – Move Down
Left Arrow – Move Left
Right Arrow – Move Right
The goal of the game is to eat the yellow fruit that randomly appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats a fruit, it grows longer, and your score increases.
Avoid hitting the walls or the snake itself, or the game will end!
Features
Simple controls using the arrow keys
Snake grows with each fruit eaten
Score displayed at the top of the screen
Game over screen showing your final score when you lose
Requirements
Python 3.x
turtle library (which is part of Python’s standard library)
How to Run
*Ensure Python is installed on your computer.
*Download the game script (snake_game.py).

About the Developer
This game was created by Ranim Abdellatif as part of my first-year studies in computer science. It was a fun way to dive into the world of game development and learn about the turtle graphics library.
Feel free to fork the repository and improve upon it. I look forward to learning and growing as a developer!
